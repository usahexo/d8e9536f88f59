<h1 id="Earn-Money-with-Casino-O’Henry’s-Blackjack-Strategy"><a href="#Earn-Money-with-Casino-O’Henry’s-Blackjack-Strategy" class="headerlink" title="Earn Money with Casino O’Henry’s Blackjack Strategy!"></a>Earn Money with Casino O’Henry’s Blackjack Strategy!</h1><p>Casino O’Henry’s blackjack strategy is simple and easy to use, even for novice players. The basic premise of the strategy is to keep your bets low when you have a good hand, and increase your bets as the hand worsens.</p>
<p>The first step is to decide how much money you want to bet on each hand. This amount should be small enough that you’re comfortable risking it, but large enough so that you have a decent chance of winning. For example, if you’re betting $5 per hand, you’ll need to win at least four hands in a row to break even.</p>
<p>Once you’ve decided how much money you’re going to bet, divide it into two stacks - one for your regular bet, and one for your double-up bet. If you lose the hand, your double-up bet goes back into your regular stack. If you win the hand, your double-up bet becomes your new regular bet.</p>
<p>Here’s an example: let’s say you’ve decided to bet $5 per hand. You would divide that into two stacks - $2.50 for your regular bet and $2.50 for your double-up bet. If you lose the hand, both bets go back into your regular stack. If you win the hand, your new regular bet would be $7 (your old regular bet plus your double up stake).</p>
<p>Once you have your betting amounts set up, it’s time to start playing! Blackjack is a game of odds and probability, so learning how to read the cards is essential for success. The goal is to get as close to 21 without going over (going over 21 results in a bust). Aces are worth 1 or 11 points, 2 through 10 are worth face value, and any other card is worth 10 points).</p>
<p>Here’s an example: let’s say you’re dealt an Ace and a 3. The Ace can be worth either 1 or 11 points, so we’ll call it 10 points for now. The 3 can be worth 3 or 6 points, so we’ll call it 3 points for now. That gives us a total of 13 points (10 + 3 &#x3D; 13).</p>
<p>If the dealer has a card that’s worth 4 or less, we hit (take another card). In this case, let’s say the dealer has a 5 showing - we would hit because the dealer has less than 21 (5 + our 13 &#x3D; 18; 18 &lt; 21). If the dealer has a 6 or more showing, we stand (stick with what we’ve got). In this case, let’s say the dealer has an 8 showing - we would stand because the dealer has more than 21 (8 + our 13 &#x3D; 21; 21 &gt; 18).</p>
<p>If we hit and get another 3 (giving us 16), we would stand because 16 is still below 21 (16 &lt; 21). If we hit and get another Ace (giving us 17), we would bust because 17 exceeds 21 (17 &gt; 21).</p>
<p>As long as you stick to Casino O’Henry’s blackjack strategy, you’ll have a better chance of winning at blackjack!</p>
