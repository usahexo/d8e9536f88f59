<h1 id="Precisely-how-to-get-banned-from-playing-online-casino-blackjack"><a href="#Precisely-how-to-get-banned-from-playing-online-casino-blackjack" class="headerlink" title="Precisely how to get banned from playing online casino blackjack"></a>Precisely how to get banned from playing online casino blackjack</h1><p>An unlucky blackjack player found herself permanently banned from playing at an online casino she frequented. Learn from her experience and be sure not to do any of the same things if you want to avoid getting yourself banned!</p>
<p>The woman in question, let’s call her Jane, had been a regular at the casino for over two years. She always made a point to observe the house rules and never violated them. However, one day she was dealt a blackjack and the dealer mistakenly hit on 16 instead of standing. This gave the dealer 21 and defeated Jane’s blackjack. The casino’s automated system determined that Jane had violated a house rule by taking advantage of the dealer’s mistake and voided her winnings as well as banning her from playing at the casino again.</p>
<p>It’s important to remember that online casinos have very strict rules in place in order to protect themselves from cheaters and advantage players. If you violate any of these rules, you run the risk of being banned from playing there. So before you start playing at an online casino, be sure to familiarize yourself with their house rules and make sure you abide by them at all times.</p>
<p>Some of the most common rules that can get you banned from an online casino include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Misrepresenting your identity or age</li>
<li>Colluding with other players * Making use of bots or other cheating devices * Taking advantage of dealer mistakes * Using multiple accounts * Bonus abuse * Fraudulent activity</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="The-one-and-only-way-to-guarantee-you’ll-be-banned-from-online-casino-blackjack"><a href="#The-one-and-only-way-to-guarantee-you’ll-be-banned-from-online-casino-blackjack" class="headerlink" title="The one and only way to guarantee you’ll be banned from online casino blackjack"></a>The one and only way to guarantee you’ll be banned from online casino blackjack</h1><p>Anyone looking to enjoy a game of blackjack online should be aware of the one and only surefire way to guarantee they will be banned from virtually all casinos - using a computer program to assist them.</p>
<p>Casinos have long been aware of the use of such programs and employ sophisticated software that can detect their use, typically resulting in an instant ban from the casino. While some programs offer users the ability to set betting limits in order to try and avoid being banned, these still won’t always work as casinos have been known to track players’ IP addresses to spot any unusual playing patterns.</p>
<p>So if you’re looking to play blackjack online, it’s best to just stick to playing for free in demo mode until you’re confident enough to start risking your own money. This way you can enjoy the game without having to worry about getting banned, and you can also hone your skills until you’re ready to take on the big boys!</p>

In fact, casinos have had to put in place a number of measures over the years to try and prevent these activities. One such measure is the use of blacklists.</p>
<p>Casinos maintain blacklists of known cheaters and scam artists. If someone on this list is caught trying to cheat or scam the casino, they will be banned from playing at that casino and, in some cases, from all casinos in that particular geographic area.</p>
<p>There are a number of methods that casinos use to compile their blacklists. The most common way is through player reports. If someone suspects another player of cheating or scamming, they will typically report them to the casino staff. The casino will then investigate the matter and, if it is determined that the player was cheating or scamming, they will be added to the blacklist.</p>
<p>In addition to player reports, casinos also keep track of known cheaters and scam artists through various other means. This can include keeping track of people who have been caught cheating in other casinos, as well as monitoring online blackjack forums for any discussions about cheating or scamming techniques.</p>
<p>While the use of blacklists is a common measure used by casinos to keep undesirables out of their games, it is not foolproof. There have been cases where people have managed to get around the blacklist by using different aliases or by travelling to different jurisdictions where different casinos operate.</p>
