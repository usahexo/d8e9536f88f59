#  Casino earnings down over $2 million from last year

Casino earnings have been down significantly over the past year. The total amount of money earned from casino games was just over $2 million, compared to $4.5 million last year.

There are a number of potential reasons for this decline in earnings. The most likely explanation is that online gaming has been increasing in popularity, and people are choosing to gamble online instead of going to a physical casino. This trend is likely to continue, as online casinos are becoming more and more sophisticated and attractive to players.

Another possibility is that the gambling industry is becoming saturated, with more and more casinos opening up each year. This could lead to a decline in profits as players have more choice and are less likely to visit casinos that are not close to them.

Whatever the reason, the decline in casino earnings is definitely a cause for concern. The industry will need to find a way to reverse this trend if it wants to stay afloat.

#  Casino earnings continue to rise each year

Casinos continue to rake in more money each year, with total earnings expected to exceed $137 billion by 2020. This is a result of several factors such as the increasing popularity of casino gaming, the rising number of millennials who are gambling, and the increasing use of mobile devices for gambling.

Casinos have seen their earnings grow consistently over the past few years. In 2017, casinos earned $130.5 billion worldwide, which is a 3.5% increase from the previous year. This growth is expected to continue over the next few years, with earnings reaching $137.3 billion by 2020.

The increasing popularity of casino gaming is a major contributor to this growth. In 2017, there were 2.3 billion casino visits worldwide, which is a 5% increase from the previous year. This trend is expected to continue over the next few years, with visit numbers reaching 2.5 billion by 2020.

The rising number of millennials who are gambling is also contributing to this growth. In 2017, millennials accounted for 34% of casino revenue, which is an increase from the 28% that millennials accounted for in 2012. This trend is expected to continue over the next few years, with millennials accounting for 37% of casino revenue by 2020.

The increasing use of mobile devices for gambling is another major contributing factor to this growth. In 2017, mobile devices accounted for nearly half (48%) of all global gambling revenue. This trend is expected to continue over the next few years, with mobile devices accounting for 54% of all global gambling revenue by 2020.

#  Casino remains a profitable business venture

Despite the numerous closures of casinos in the past few years, the gambling industry remains a profitable business venture. The main reason for casino closures is the increasing competition from tribal casinos and lotteries. In order to remain competitive and profitable, casinos are now offering more gaming options and better customer service.

Another reason for casino closures is the sluggish economy. When people have less money to spend, they are less likely to gamble. However, even during recessions, gambling revenues have continued to grow. This growth can be attributed to the increase in online gambling.

Casinos are also benefiting from the legalization of sports betting. Sports betting was previously illegal in most states, but that is now changing. With the legalization of sports betting, casinos will be able to offer more gaming options and attract more customers.

The bottom line is that casinos remain a profitable business venture, and there is still room for growth in this industry.

#  Casino faces lawsuits over earnings

Casino companies across the United States are currently facing a barrage of lawsuits alleging that they misrepresented their earnings to investors, according to a [recent report](<https://www.wsj.com/articles/casinos-face-investor-lawsuits-over-earnings-claims-1533855801>) in the Wall Street Journal.

The suits, brought by investors who bought casino stocks in the belief that the companies were making more money than they actually were, claim that the casinos used accounting tricks to artificially boost their earnings.

One of the lawsuits was filed against Wynn Resorts, which is owned by Steve Wynn, who has been accused of sexual harassment and assault by dozens of women. The company denies any wrongdoing.

The lawsuits could have a significant impact on the casino industry, which is already dealing with falling revenue and competition from online gambling.

#  Casino accused of tax fraud

The owner of a casino in the city of Reno has been accused of tax fraud. Documents obtained by the local news media suggest that the casino owner has failed to declare income and profits from the casino in recent years, resulting in a loss of millions of dollars in unpaid taxes.

The state's taxation authority is believed to be investigating the matter, and it is possible that the casino owner could face criminal charges if found guilty of tax fraud. The alleged offences are thought to have been taking place over a period of several years.

In a statement released to the media, the casino owner denied any wrongdoing and insisted that he had paid all taxes owed. He claimed that the allegations were part of a smear campaign by his rivals.

The authorities have declined to comment on the case while it is still under investigation.
