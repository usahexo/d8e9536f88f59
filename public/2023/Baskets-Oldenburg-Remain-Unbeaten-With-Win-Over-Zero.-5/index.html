      <h1 id="Baskets-Oldenburg-Remain-Unbeaten-With-Win-Over-Zero-5"><a href="#Baskets-Oldenburg-Remain-Unbeaten-With-Win-Over-Zero-5" class="headerlink" title="Baskets Oldenburg Remain Unbeaten With Win Over Zero. 5"></a>Baskets Oldenburg Remain Unbeaten With Win Over Zero. 5</h1><p>Baskets Oldenburg remain unbeaten with win over Zero. 5 and continue their good start to the season. The team from Lower Saxony were in control for the entire game, and will be delighted with the win.</p>
<p>Zero. 5 are one of the weaker teams in the league, and it was only a matter of time before Baskets Oldenburg asserted their authority. The home side had more than 60% of the possession in the first half, and they created plenty of chances.</p>
<p>It was no surprise when they took the lead midway through the first half, with Stefan Breitkreuz scoring from close range. The remainder of the first half was a pretty uneventful affair, but Baskets Oldenburg went into the break with a 1-0 lead.</p>
<p>The second half followed a similar pattern, with Baskets Oldenburg dominating proceedings and creating chances. It was only a matter of time before they doubled their lead, and that’s exactly what happened when Christopher Kramer scored from close range.</p>
<p>That goal killed off any hopes Zero. 5 had of getting back into the game, and Baskets Oldenburg cruised to a comfortable 2-0 win. It was an impressive performance from Stefan Breitkreuz and Christopher Kramer, who were both instrumental in helping Baskets Oldenburg secure all three points.</p>
<h1 id="Baskets-Oldenburg-Continue-Dominance-With-Fifth-Straight-Win"><a href="#Baskets-Oldenburg-Continue-Dominance-With-Fifth-Straight-Win" class="headerlink" title="Baskets Oldenburg Continue Dominance With Fifth Straight Win"></a>Baskets Oldenburg Continue Dominance With Fifth Straight Win</h1><p>The Baskets Oldenburg continued their winning streak with a 111-92 victory over Telekom Bonn. The win was their fifth in a row, and it leaves them in first place in the Bundesliga standings.</p>
<p>It was a balanced scoring attack for Oldenburg, with six players reaching double figures. American center Jeremy Evans led the way with 18 points and 12 rebounds, while German forward Philipp Schwethelm added 17 points.</p>
<p>Bonn had no answer for Evans inside, and he consistently produced at both ends of the court. He was a perfect 8 for 8 from the free throw line, and his energetic play helped trigger a decisive run by Oldenburg in the third quarter.</p>
<p>The home side led by just three points at halftime, but they outscored Bonn 31-15 in the third quarter to take complete control of the game. Oldenburg never looked back after that, and they coasted to an easy victory in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>This was another impressive win for Oldenburg, who have now beaten some of the top teams in Germany this season. They will be looking to continue their winning streak when they face BG Göttingen next weekend.</p>
<h1 id="Baskets-Oldenburg-Surge-To-The-Top-Of-The-Table-After-win-Over-Zero-5"><a href="#Baskets-Oldenburg-Surge-To-The-Top-Of-The-Table-After-win-Over-Zero-5" class="headerlink" title="Baskets Oldenburg Surge To The Top Of The Table After win Over Zero. 5"></a>Baskets Oldenburg Surge To The Top Of The Table After win Over Zero. 5</h1><p>The Baskets Oldenburg team has had an impressive streak lately, with a current record of 9-1. This past weekend, they beat the Zero. 5 team 102-85 and improved to the top of the Bundesliga table.</p>
<p>Baskets Oldenburg controlled the game from start to finish, with a strong opening quarter that set the tone for the rest of the match. They shot 50 percent from the field and 42 percent from 3-point range, while holding Zero. 5 to just 38 percent shooting.</p>
<p>Dorian Green led the way for Baskets Oldenburg with 21 points on 8-of-13 shooting, while Niklas Kiel scored 20 points on 7-of-13 shooting. Other contributors for Baskets Oldenburg included Brad Wanamaker (14 points) and Johannes Voigtmann (10 points, 12 rebounds).</p>
<p>With this win, Baskets Oldenburg improves to first place in the Bundesliga table with a record of 9-1. Next up for them is a matchup against medi Bayreuth on November 25th.</p>
<h1 id="Zero-5-Slip-Up-Baskets-Oldenburg-Take-Advantage"><a href="#Zero-5-Slip-Up-Baskets-Oldenburg-Take-Advantage" class="headerlink" title="Zero. 5 Slip Up, Baskets Oldenburg Take Advantage"></a>Zero. 5 Slip Up, Baskets Oldenburg Take Advantage</h1><p>FC Bayern Munich came into their matchup against the last-place team in the Bundesliga, BG Gottingen, with high expectations. The match was billed as a chance for Bayern to get some much-needed practice in before their Champions League semifinal matchup against Liverpool.</p>
<p>Instead, the Bundesliga champions struggled mightily against BG Gottingen and had to come from behind to win 77-75. This was only Bayern’s second win in their past five matches and it keeps them in 3rd place in the Bundesliga, three points behind 2nd-place Borussia Dortmund.</p>
<p>The biggest reason for Bayern’s struggles against BG Gottingen was turnovers. They committed a season-high 24 turnovers in the match, which led to 29 points for BG Gottingen. This was especially costly in the first half, when Bayern only led 30-29 despite having an 11-point advantage in rebounds and an 18-2 edge in assists.</p>
<p>One of the biggest culprits for Bayern’s turnovers was point guard Darius Adams. He had six turnovers on his own and often looked out of control on offense. This was a stark contrast from Adams’ performance against Valencia in the first leg of the Champions League semifinals, when he had 16 points and six assists.</p>
<p>Another issue for Bayern was their inability to hit shots from outside. They only made two of their 22 three-point attempts in the game, which led to them getting outrebounded 44-30. Their leading scorer was Maxi Kleber with 16 points, followed by Thiago Alcantara with 14 points off the bench.</p>
<p>It wasn’t all bad for Bayern though. They were able to come back from a seven-point deficit in the fourth quarter and won thanks to some clutch plays from veteran players like Arjen Robben and Robert Lewandowski. Lewandowski had 12 points in the game and appears to be fully recovered from his thigh injury.</p>
<p>The win over BG Gottingen definitely wasn’t pretty, but it does give Bayern some momentum heading into their Champions League semifinal matchup against Liverpool.</p>
<h1 id="Zero-5-Can’t-Stop-Baskets-Oldenburg’s-Hot-Streak"><a href="#Zero-5-Can’t-Stop-Baskets-Oldenburg’s-Hot-Streak" class="headerlink" title="Zero. 5 Can’t Stop Baskets Oldenburg’s Hot Streak"></a>Zero. 5 Can’t Stop Baskets Oldenburg’s Hot Streak</h1><p>With a convincing 97-78 victory over the Walter Tigers Tubingen, Oldenburg has now won five consecutive games and remain undefeated in the Bundesliga.</p>
<p>Baskets Oldenburg coach Ricard Peckovic was delighted with his team’s performance. “We didn’t start out well, but we picked up our intensity in the second half and played some very good defense,” said Peckovic. “It was important that we got this win.”</p>
<p>Oldenburg’s success is largely down to its impressive starting five, who are averaging a combined 49 points per game. Center Chris Kramer leads the way with an average of 16 points per game, followed by forwards Philipp Schwethelm (14.8 points) and Jamel McLean (13.4 points). Guard Laszlo Nemeth (11.8 points) and forward Per Gudmundsson (10 points) are also contributing valuable scoring output.</p>
<p>The hot streak has propelled Oldenburg up to third place in the Bundesliga standings, just two games behind league leaders Bayern Munich. With such a talented starting lineup, it is no surprise that Oldenburg is starting to make a name for itself in European basketball circles.</p>
