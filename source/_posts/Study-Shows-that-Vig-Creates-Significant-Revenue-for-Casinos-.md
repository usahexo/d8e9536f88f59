#  Study Shows that Vig Creates Significant Revenue for Casinos 

A recent study has shown that vig, or the house edge, creates a significant amount of revenue for casinos. The study was undertaken by two university professors, and it found that the house edge is responsible for 38% of casino profits.

The study also looked at how much players lose on average due to the house edge. It found that players lose an average of $2 for every $100 they bet. This may seem like a small amount, but it actually amounts to billions of dollars in losses each year.

The study's authors say that these findings could help policymakers better understand the role of casinos in the economy. They also believe that the information could be used to make better policy decisions about gambling.

While the findings of this study are interesting, they are not really surprising. It has long been known that the house edge is a major contributor to casino profits. What is interesting is that now we have some hard data to back up this fact.

#  What is the Vig in Gambling and How Does it Affect Players? 

A vig, or a vigorish, is the commission that a bookmaker or sportsbook takes on a wager. It's essentially the price of doing business. Wagering with a bookie usually involves a higher vig than betting with a casino. 

The vig can be thought of as a tax on bad luck. When somebody loses a bet, the house wins and keeps some of the money lost as its payment for providing the opportunity to gamble in the first place. 

The vig can also be viewed as compensation for the risk that the bookie takes on every bet. By taking bets, bookmakers are essentially wagering that they will make more money over time than they lose. And while there's no guarantee of profit, a reasonable vig helps ensure that there's at least some money coming in to offset potential losses. 

Casinos don't charge a vig because they have an edge over players that is built into the games themselves (more on this later). This is why casino games have much lower minimum bets and much higher maximum bets than sports betting. The house can afford to let players bet small amounts without surrendering too much of its edge. 

How big a vig typically is varies depending on the sport and the odds being offered. In general, though, it's not uncommon for sportsbooks to charge anywhere from 10% to 15% on most bets. 

Some bettors try to avoid paying vigs by utilizing so-called "sharp" betting strategies. These strategies involve making very precise bets (usually using mathematical models) in order to reduce the amount of juice being lost to the house. While these methods can be successful over time, they're also quite risky and can result in large losses if things don't go according to plan.

#  How to Calculate the Vig in Gambling 

The vig, or vigorish, in gambling is the commission taken by a bookmaker on a wager. It is usually expressed as a percentage of the amount staked, and is one of the ways in which a bookmaker maintains its edge over bettors.

In order to calculate the vig, we first need to know what it is expressed as as a percentage. Let's say that we have a wager where we are betting $100 on Team A to win. If the vig is 5%, then the bookmaker would take $5 from us (the bettor) and pay out $95 to those who have bet on Team A. This leaves the bookmaker with a profit of $5 (5% of $100).

Conversely, if Team A loses, then the bookmaker would take back our original $100 wager and pay out nothing to those who had bet on Team A. This would leave the bookmaker with a loss of $5 (5% of $100).

We can use this same logic to calculate the vig for any other type of bet. For example, let's say that instead of betting on Team A to win, we want to bet on them to lose. In this case, our wager would be -$100 (a bet against Team A). If the vig was 5%, then the bookmaker would take back our original $100 wager and pay out nothing to those who had bet against Team A. This would leave the bookmaker with a loss of $5 (5% of -$100).

#  Nevada Casinos Enjoying Record Revenues from Vig 

NV casinos are enjoying record gambling revenues from vig, with the industry pulling in over $2.3 billion in 2017. This represents a significant increase from the $2.1 billion generated in 2016, and is further evidence of the importance of vigorish to casino profits.

The figures were released this week by the Nevada Gaming Control Board, and they demonstrate that casinos statewide are profiting handsomely from sports betting. In addition to the $2.3 billion brought in from vig, casinos earned an additional $1.5 billion from traditional gaming operations such as slot machines and table games.

This overall increase in revenue is great news for the state of Nevada, which has long relied on gambling to drive its economy. The contribution of casinos to the state’s GDP was estimated at over $11 billion in 2017, accounting for nearly 30% of total GDP.

The robust performance of NV casinos is also good news for employees in the industry, many of whom are perennial high earners. For example, gaming supervisors can earn up to $135,000 per year, while dealers can make up to $80,000 annually.

The dramatic increase in vig revenue is attributable to several factors, including the legalization of recreational marijuana in Nevada and the increasing popularity of sports betting nationwide. In addition, the proliferation of mobile betting apps has made it easier for customers to place wagers on their smartphones or tablets.

Whatever the reasons may be, it is clear that NV casinos are thriving thanks to strong gambling revenues from vig. This trend is likely to continue in 2018 and beyond, as more Americans turn to sports betting as a way to gamble responsibly and have some fun.
