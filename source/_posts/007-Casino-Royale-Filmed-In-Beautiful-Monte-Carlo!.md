Casino Royale is a 2006 spy film, the 21st installment in the James Bond series produced by Eon Productions and distributed by Columbia Pictures. It is the third screen adaptation of Ian Fleming's 1953 novel of the same name, following Dr. No and On Her Majesty's Secret Service.

The film stars Daniel Craig as the fictional MI6 agent James Bond and Eva Green as Vesper Lynd. It is set at the beginning of Bond's career as Agent 007, just as he is earning his licence to kill. The plot sees Bond being sent to Madagascar and then to Montenegro to defeat a terrorist threat to a NATO summit; during the course of his mission he also falls in love with Vesper Lynd.

Casino Royale was released on 14 November 2006 after a five-day sneak preview event held in London from 30 October. It became the highest-grossing James Bond film until 2012's Skyfall surpassed it in global box office receipts. Critical reception was mixed but mostly positive; praise was directed at Craig's performance and the action sequences, while criticism focused on the screenplay (especially its lack of wit), directing, and pacing.

Craig reprised his role for Quantum of Solace (2008).

Principal photography for Casino Royale took place at Pinewood Studios, with locations in London, Italy, Morocco and Austria. The shoot concluded at Barrandov Studios in Prague. For the first time since Die Another Day (2002), Eon employed computer-generated imagery to create stunt sequences instead of relying on physical effects.[5] Casino Royale was also the first Bond film to utilise the services of a professional fight choreographer,[6] Russ Brown,[7] and stunt coordinator Gary Powell.[8]
