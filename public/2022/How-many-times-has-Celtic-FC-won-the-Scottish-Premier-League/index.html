The club was founded in 1887 and has won the Scottish Premier League on 43 occasions, most recently in 2017. Celtic also reached the final of the UEFA Champions League in 2003, where they narrowly lost out to Spanish giants FC Barcelona.</p>

<h1 id="How-many-times-has-Celtic-FC-won-the-Scottish-League-Cup"><a href="#How-many-times-has-Celtic-FC-won-the-Scottish-League-Cup" class="headerlink" title="How many times has Celtic FC won the Scottish League Cup?"></a>How many times has Celtic FC won the Scottish League Cup?</h1><p>This is a question that many football fans will be able to answer without too much trouble. Celtic FC are the most successful team in the history of the Scottish League Cup, with 37 victories.</p>
<p>The first ever edition of the tournament was held back in 1946, and Celtic emerged as the winners. They would go on to lift the trophy on another 26 occasions, making them by far and away the most successful team in the competition’s history.</p>
<p>Their nearest rivals Rangers FC have won the League Cup on just 21 occasions. This means that Celtic have a substantial lead when it comes to this particular accolade.</p>
<p>It has been a while since Celtic last lifted the trophy though. their last victory came back in 2012, when they defeated arch-rivals Rangers 2-1 in the final. Since then, they have been runners-up on two occasions – once in 2013 and again in 2016.</p>
<p>So, can Celtic make it three wins in a row and re-claim their title as champions of the Scottish League Cup? Or will one of their rivals finally manage to snatch it away from them? Only time will tell…</p>
