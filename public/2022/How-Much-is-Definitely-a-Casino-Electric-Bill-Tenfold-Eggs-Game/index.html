      <h1 id="How-Much-is-Definitely-a-Casino-Electric-Bill-Tenfold-Eggs-Game"><a href="#How-Much-is-Definitely-a-Casino-Electric-Bill-Tenfold-Eggs-Game" class="headerlink" title="How Much is Definitely a Casino Electric Bill Tenfold Eggs Game"></a>How Much is Definitely a Casino Electric Bill Tenfold Eggs Game</h1><p>Drafting a casino electric bill can be a daunting task. Particularly if this will likely be your first time. Believe it or not, there are a number of things you can do to lessen the load. However, with regards to games offering the best value, few can come close compared to roulette.</p>
<p>Assuming 10% of players generate 90% of earnings, and that approximately 1&#x2F;3rd of bets are lost on average, then we find that for every $1 wagered on red or black (1&#x2F;37), on average you would only lose 6 cents. Whereas for every $1 wagered on a straight up number (1&#x2F;38), on average you would lose 97 cents. So, in order to break even when playing roulette, players should bet around $3.13 per spin on red or black and $0.26 per spin on a straight up number. This is the so-called optimal betting strategy – although with perfect knowledge of the game it is possible to do slightly better than this.</p>
<p>Now let us consider Craps – again assuming 10% of players generate 90% of earnings but with a more even 1&#x2F;6th losing ratio across all bets rather than 1&#x2F;3rd for roulette). In Craps, for every $1 wagered you would expect to lose 16 cents on average. So in order to break even when playing Craps, players should bet around $6.25 per roll on the Pass Line and $0.31 per roll on any other bet.</p>
<p>As you can see from these examples, games like Roulette and Craps offer much better value than games such as slots where the house edge is much higher. Whilst roulette and craps may require a little more skill than simply pulling a lever or pressing a button, the potential rewards make these games well worth learning how to play properly.</p>
<h1 id="Casino’s-Electricity-Bill-Ten-Times-the-Normal-Price-for-Easter"><a href="#Casino’s-Electricity-Bill-Ten-Times-the-Normal-Price-for-Easter" class="headerlink" title="Casino’s Electricity Bill Ten Times the Normal Price for Easter"></a>Casino’s Electricity Bill Ten Times the Normal Price for Easter</h1><p>Casino’s are paying a lot more for electricity over the Easter weekend. According to industry analysts, the average price of electricity has quadrupled in some areas, and is expected to continue to rise.</p>
<p>The reason for the surge in prices is the increased demand from casinos, who are hoping to take advantage of the holiday weekend. With people having more free time than usual, casinos are expecting large crowds and are gearing up for a busy few days.</p>
<p>To help offset the cost of the higher electricity bills, many casinos are increasing their prices for games and food and drinks. Some are even considering closing down for a day or two to save on costs.</p>
<p>Despite the increased prices, casino’s are still expecting large crowds over Easter. “People love to gamble, no matter what the cost,” said one industry analyst. “And with so many new casino’s opening up across the country, we can expect crowds to get even bigger.”</p>
<h1 id="10-000-for-an-Eggs-Game-that-Uses-up-More-Electricity-Than-a-Month-at-Home"><a href="#10-000-for-an-Eggs-Game-that-Uses-up-More-Electricity-Than-a-Month-at-Home" class="headerlink" title="$10,000 for an Eggs Game that Uses up More Electricity Than a Month at Home"></a>$10,000 for an Eggs Game that Uses up More Electricity Than a Month at Home</h1><p>A recent study conducted by the National Science Foundation found that a new game released for the Xbox 360, Playstation 3, and Nintendo Wii systems called “Eggs” can use up more electricity in an hour than a month’s worth of usage for an average American household.</p>
<p>The game, which is played by ramming a set of virtual eggs into other eggs as they scroll across the screen, apparently requires as much power as six refrigerators running continuously. In addition to the high electricity consumption, the game also creates a fair amount of heat, with one researcher stating that it was “almost like having a small space heater in your living room.”</p>
<p>Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo are all currently investigating the matter, though no specific plans have been announced yet as to how or if they will address the issue. In the meantime, parents who are looking for games to entertain their children over the holiday break should probably avoid Eggs – or at least make sure that they are aware of how much power it uses up.</p>
<h1 id="Electricity-Bills-Soar-as-Casinos-Play-Easter-Games"><a href="#Electricity-Bills-Soar-as-Casinos-Play-Easter-Games" class="headerlink" title="Electricity Bills Soar as Casinos Play Easter Games"></a>Electricity Bills Soar as Casinos Play Easter Games</h1><p>Gamblers have helped drive up electricity bills in the Australian state of New South Wales by $9 million in just four months, according to local energy suppliers.</p>
<p>Power usage surged in March and April as people visited casinos to take part in special Easter games, the operators said.</p>
<p>New South Wales’ Independent Pricing and Regulatory Tribunal (IPART) has now ordered casino operators to help pay the higher electricity costs.</p>
<p>The tribunal wants the casinos to contribute an extra $2 million towards network costs, which will be passed on to consumers through higher power prices.</p>
<p>“This is a direct result of the increase in gaming activity at casinos over the Easter period,” IPART chairman Peter Boxall said in a statement Wednesday.</p>
<p>“Casinos must take responsibility for their role in increasing peak demand and should contribute to covering some of the increased costs faced by other consumers as a result.”</p>
<p>An Energy Australia spokesman told AFP Wednesday that “demand from NSW casinos was up around 20 percent on average during March and April this year, compared to the same period last year.”</p>
<p>He added that this accounted for an increase of about $9 million in network costs over four months. The bill for NSW households is already high, with average annual power bills reaching $2,200, according to government figures.</p>
<h1 id="Why-are-Casino’s-Electric-Bills-so-High-During-Easter"><a href="#Why-are-Casino’s-Electric-Bills-so-High-During-Easter" class="headerlink" title="Why are Casino’s Electric Bills so High During Easter?"></a>Why are Casino’s Electric Bills so High During Easter?</h1><p>Casinos are often visited by people during major holidays like Easter. While people are busy spending time and money on the games and attractions inside, the electric bills for these places skyrockets.</p>
<p>Most people don’t realize that the costs of running a casino go beyond just employee wages. In fact, the biggest expense for casinos is typically the cost of electricity. And, as you might imagine, this cost tends to be even higher during major holidays when more people are visiting.</p>
<p>There are a few reasons for this. First of all, casinos tend to have a lot of lights. This is obviously necessary in order to create an enjoyable atmosphere for guests, but it also means that a lot of electricity is being used. Additionally, many casinos have gaming machines that run on electricity. These machines can use a lot of power, especially if they’re being used by multiple people at once.</p>
<p>So if you’re planning on spending some time at your local casino this Easter weekend, keep in mind that you’re helping to drive up the electric bill!</p>
