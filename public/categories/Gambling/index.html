        <h1 id="How-To-Win-GTA-5-Casino-Blackjack-Strategy"><a href="#How-To-Win-GTA-5-Casino-Blackjack-Strategy" class="headerlink" title="How To Win GTA 5 Casino Blackjack Strategy"></a>How To Win GTA 5 Casino Blackjack Strategy</h1><p>GTA 5 casino blackjack strategy can help you win big at the casino tables. With a bit of practice, you can use these tips and tricks to walk away with some serious winnings.</p>
<p>First and foremost, it’s important to understand the basic rules of blackjack. In short, the aim of the game is to draw cards totalling 21, or as close to 21 as possible, without going over. The player beats the dealer if their total is higher than the dealer’s total, without exceeding 21. If both the player and dealer have 21 (a ‘blackjack’), the hand is a draw.</p>
<p>To play blackjack in GTA 5’s casino, you will need a minimum of $1,000 in your bankroll. The minimum bet per hand is also $1, so start by betting this amount. If you lose 3 hands in a row, you will be automatically ejected from the casino so make sure your bankroll can sustain a few losses!</p>
<p>There are different strategies that can be used when playing blackjack in the casino – but we recommend starting with basic strategy first. This involves making certain decisions based on the cards that have already been played. For example, if you have an Ace and a 10-point card (a Jack, Queen or King), then you should ‘stand’ – as your total would be 21 and you are likely to beat the dealer.</p>
<p>If you have two cards that add up to 12 or more points, then you should ‘hit’ (take another card). This is because 12 is close to 21 and there is a good chance of getting a high value card which will put you in a winning position.</p>
<p>If you are stuck between hitting and standing, then use this basic principle: always hit if your total is below 17 points, and always stand if your total is 17 points or higher. This will give you the best chance of winning against the dealer.</p>
<p>There are also some advanced tips that can be used when playing blackjack at GTA 5’s casino:<br>-Double down on any two cards – provided your total is 10 points or more. For example, if you have an Ace and 8 (totalling 19 points), then double down for a better chance of winning.<br>-Split pairs evenly – when you are dealt two cards of equal value (e.g two 8s). This gives you twice as many chances to get closer to 21 than if you were just using one card.<br>-Insurance bets – these bets are optional but they can offer good returns if used correctly. When offered insurance by the dealer, make sure that your first two cards add up to 21 (or less). If they don’t then decline the insurance offer – as it’s likely that it won’t pay off in the long run!</p>

<h1 id="1-Stick-To-Basic-Strategy"><a href="#1-Stick-To-Basic-Strategy" class="headerlink" title="1. Stick To Basic Strategy"></a>1.

<h1 id="3-Bet-Low"><a href="#3-Bet-Low" class="headerlink" title="3. Bet Low"></a>3. Bet Low</h1><p>When starting out at blackjack, it’s best to bet low until you become more familiar with the game. This will limit your losses if you happen to lose early on and also give you more chances to win bigger payouts as the game progresses.</p>
<h1 id="4-Know-When-To-Bust"><a href="#4-Know-When-To-Bust" class="headerlink" title="4. Know When To Bust"></a>4. Know When To Bust</h1><p>Knowing when to bust is crucial if you want to come out ahead at blackjack. If your hand total exceeds 21, you automatically lose no matter what the dealer’s hand total is. So make sure you know when it’s best to stand or hit when playing.</p>
<h1 id="5-Use-Card-Counters"><a href="#5-Use-Card-Counters" class="headerlink" title="5. Use Card Counters"></a>5.

<p>Next, try to find a table that has a low minimum bet. This will allow you to play for longer periods of time without having to risk too much money.</p>
<p>Then, take some time to practice. The more you play, the better you’ll become at making winning decisions.</p>
<p>When it comes time to start playing for real money, always remember to stick to your budget. Don’t let your emotions get the best of you; if you start losing money, walk away and come back another day.</p>
<p>Finally, use the following tips to give yourself the best chance of winning at blackjack:<br>-Never Split Aces or Tens<br>-Split 8s and 9s only if the dealer has a 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 as their up card<br>-Double down on 11 if the dealer has a 2 through 9 as their up card<br>-Hit on 12 or higher if the dealer has an Ace or 10 as their up card</p>
