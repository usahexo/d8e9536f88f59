<h1 id="‘Where-To-Put-The-Chomas-Engraving-Tool-In-The-Cricut-Explore-Air-Machine-’"><a href="#‘Where-To-Put-The-Chomas-Engraving-Tool-In-The-Cricut-Explore-Air-Machine-’" class="headerlink" title="‘Where To Put The Chomas Engraving Tool In The Cricut Explore Air Machine?’"></a>‘Where To Put The Chomas Engraving Tool In The Cricut Explore Air Machine?’</h1><p>When it comes to the Cricut Explore air machine, there are many tools that you can use with it. One of these tools is the Chomas engraving tool. This tool is perfect for adding details to your projects. So, where do you put the Chomas engraving tool in the Cricut Explore air machine?</p>
<p>There are three places where you can put the Chomas engraving tool in the Cricut Explore air machine. The first place is on the carriage. The second place is on the back side of the machine. The third place is on the top of the machine.</p>
<p>Each placement has its own benefits and drawbacks. Let’s take a look at each one.</p>
<p>The carriage is the place where you would typically put your blade when you are cutting your project. This is also where you would put the Chomas engraving tool when you are using it to add details to your project. When you put the Chomas engraving tool in this location, it will be right in front of you as you are working on your project. This makes it easy to access and use.</p>
<p>However, there is one downside to putting the Chomas engraving tool in this location. Since it is right in front of you, it can get in the way while you are working on your project. You may find that you have to adjust your hand position slightly to avoid hitting it with your hand as you are working on your project.</p>
<p>The next place to put the Chomas engraving tool is on the back side of the machine. When you put it in this location, it will be behind your project as you are working on it. This means that you won’t be able to see what you are doing as well as you would be able to if it were in front of you on the carriage. However, since it is not in front of you, it will not get in your way as you are working on your project.</p>
<p>The final place to put the Chomas engraving tool is on top of the machine. When you put it in this location, it will be right above your project as you are working on it. This means that you will be able to see what you are doing very well and that it will not get in your way as you work on your project. However, there is one downside to this placement – it can be difficult to reach if needed.</p>

<p>If you are wondering how to put the Chomas engraving tool in your Cricut Explore air machine, it is actually very easy. The first thing you need to do is remove the blade housing from the machine. Next, you will want to remove the screws on the top of the Chomas engraving tool that hold it in place. After that, you can simply slide the Chomas engraving tool into the spot where the blade housing was and replace the screws. Make sure that everything is tightened securely and then put the blade housing back on the machine.</p>
<p>Now that you know how to put the Chomas engraving tool in your Cricut Explore air machine, you can start using it to create beautiful designs. Be sure to experiment with different fonts, colors, and effects to create something truly unique.</p>
