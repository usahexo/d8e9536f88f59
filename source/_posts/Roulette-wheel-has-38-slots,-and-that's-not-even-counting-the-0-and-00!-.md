#  Roulette wheel has 38 slots, and that's not even counting the 0 and 00! 

The roulette wheel is, without a doubt, one of the most iconic symbols in gambling history. Roulette is a game that has been around for centuries, and its popularity is only increasing. But what many people don't know is that the roulette wheel has 38 slots, and that's not even counting the 0 and 00!

Most people think that there are only 36 slots on the roulette wheel, but there are in fact 38. The 0 and 00 slots are located at opposite ends of the wheel, and they both payout at 35 to 1. So if you're ever playing roulette and you see someone bet on those two numbers, you know they're doing it for the sole purpose of winning big!

Interestingly enough, the 0 slot was actually created by accident. In 1842, a French physicist named Blaise Pascal was trying to invent a perpetual motion machine, and he ended up creating the first roulette wheel instead. The 0 slot was added a few years later when casinos started popping up across Europe.

So now you know a little bit more about the roulette wheel. Be sure to keep this information in mind next time you decide to play this classic casino game!

#  Did you know that the house edge on a roulette table is about 2.7%? 

If you're unfamiliar with the term, the "house edge" is simply a percentage representing how much in expected profit the house will make on any given bet. 

This means that for every $100 you gamble on roulette, the house will expect to earn an average of $2.70 in return. 

Naturally, this doesn't mean you can't make money playing roulette - it just means that the odds are stacked against you. In fact, with a bit of skill and some shrewd decision-making, it's completely possible to overcome the house edge and walk away a winner. 

Of course, if roulette is your game of choice, there's no reason why you can't give it a try online.

#  You can make some serious money playing roulette if you know what you're doing 

I'm not a gambler by nature, but I have to say that roulette is one of the most entertaining casino games around. Not only that, but it can also be profitable if you know how to play it correctly.

Here are some basic tips for playing roulette:

- Make sure to bet on black or red, odds are 50/50 and you have a good chance of winning.

- Avoid betting on single numbers - the odds are against you and the payouts are low.

- Bet on multiple numbers instead for better odds and bigger payouts.

- Use outside bets whenever possible (e.g. betting on red or black, odd or even, etc). This gives you better odds than betting on individual numbers.

- If the table is hot, walk away - don't try to chase your losses. The odds will eventually catch up with you.

Following these tips should help you make some serious money playing roulette!
