"How often should you update your wardrobe?" is a question that has been asked by many people. The answer to this question is it depends on how often you wear your clothes. If you wear your clothes every day, then you will need to update your wardrobe more often than someone who only wears their clothes once a week.

Another thing to consider is the type of clothing you are wearing. If you are wearing clothes that are made from natural materials, such as cotton or wool, then they will last longer than synthetic materials like polyester. So, if you are only going to wear your clothes a few times before washing them, you may want to choose clothes made from synthetic materials so that you can update your wardrobe more often.

This can be done by writing down the date each time you wear a piece of clothing on a piece of paper or in a spreadsheet. Once you have tracked how often each piece of clothing is being worn, you can then decide which pieces of clothing need to be updated more often.
